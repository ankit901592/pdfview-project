The application utilizes well-defined React components that emphasize reusability and maintainability.
Components are organized logically to keep the application scalable and easy to extend.
State Management:

Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing local component state.
Global state is managed using Redux Toolkit, ensuring a smooth data flow across the application.
API Integration:

The app makes asynchronous API calls (e.g., using axios) to fetch data.
Fetch data is stored in Redux, and the state is updated accordingly.
Error Handling:

Proper error handling is implemented for API calls.
Edge cases such as no internet connection, API failures, and unexpected data formats are gracefully handled.
Responsive Design:

The app is fully responsive, with a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
Mobile-first design ensures that the UI/UX is optimal across various devices.
UI/UX Design:

The user interface (UI) is designed to be clean, intuitive, and user-friendly.
Buttons, icons, and other interactive elements have smooth transitions, hover effects, and clear feedback.
Accessibility:

The application follows accessibility best practices, ensuring a broad user base can interact with the content effectively.
Technologies Used
React.js for building the user interface.
Redux Toolkit for state management.
Axios for making API calls.
CSS Modules for styling with a modular approach.
Responsive Design using media queries for mobile and desktop views.

Functionality Overview
PDF Data Fetching:

The application fetches data from an external API using axios and stores the data in Redux.
The data includes PDF details, which can be viewed or removed.
Search and Filter:

The user can search for specific PDFs by name, and the list dynamically updates based on the search query.
View and Remove Buttons:

Each PDF has a View button to view the details of the PDF.
A Remove button is available for each item to delete it from the list.
Error Handling:

If the API request fails or returns an error, the user will see an error message displayed on the UI.
Proper loading states are shown while the data is being fetched.
Code Structure and Best Practices
Componentization:

Components are modular and reusable.
The code follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) for each component.
Folder Structure:

src/
components/: Reusable components (e.g., PdfViewer, SearchBar).
redux/: Redux-related files, including actions, reducers, and selectors.
utils/: Utility functions and helpers.
styles/: Global and component-specific styles (CSS Modules).
App.js: Main application component.
index.js: Entry point to the React app.
Code Quality:

Clean and readable code with consistent formatting.
Proper comments and JSDoc annotations where necessary for better clarity.
Error Handling
API Error Handling:

If the API call fails (network issues, invalid response), a user-friendly error message is displayed.
Edge Case Handling:

If no data is returned from the API, the app displays a message indicating that no results were found.
API responses are validated before being processed.
UI/UX Design and Responsiveness
Mobile-First Design:

The layout is designed to be mobile-first and is fully responsive using CSS media queries.
The UI adjusts automatically based on screen size, with components scaling appropriately for both mobile and desktop devices.
Interactive Elements:

Buttons have hover effects to provide clear feedback to the user.
Smooth transitions and animations are implemented for a polished user experience.
Grid Layout:

The PDF items are displayed in a responsive grid layout, which adjusts to different screen sizes.
Bonus Features
Performance Optimizations:

Lazy loading of data is implemented to optimize initial load time.
Reactâ€™s useMemo and useCallback hooks are used where appropriate to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Additional Features:

Ability to sort PDF data alphabetically.
Option to filter PDFs based on categories or tags.
Accessibility Enhancements:

Ensured that buttons, links, and interactive elements are properly accessible to screen readers.
Improved focus management for keyboard navigation.
